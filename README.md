Generate QR Code on Heltec ESP32 kit with inbuilt OLED

QR code generation is possible on Heltec ESP32 kit that comes with OLED. 
However due to the display size limitation, the maximum number of characters that it can convert to a QR code is also much less. 
The tests I did so far could only code less than 15 characters.
